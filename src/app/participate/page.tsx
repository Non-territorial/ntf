      Host | Anyone can host an exhibition in any locationâ€”whether it&apos;s a home kitchen, loft, parking lot, hotel room, remote village, gym, school, university, or even a private bank reception hall.<br /><br />

      The possibilities are limitless.<br /><br />
      To host an exhibition, submit an inquiry, pay the development and production license fee, and receive all the &apos;Ready-Made Exhibition&apos; materials and instructions.<br /><br />
      Spectator | Audiences can participate by booking an experience at selected exhibition, provided the host opens it to the public.
